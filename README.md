# python-snake

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using Python. The game is run in the console and uses the curses library for rendering.

To run it git clone the repo and cd into the python-snake folder

then run

```
python main.py
```

Note:
This game should be run in a console or terminal, not in an IDE like PyCharm or Jupyter Notebook.

enjoy :)
